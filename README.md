# Movies-ETL
Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into existing tables. 

# Overview
Using Python, Pandas and the ETL process, this project extracted data from three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data. Performing transformation steps to clean the data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, these datasets can then be merged into one dataset. The ratings dataset and the newly transformed merged dataset are then loaded into a PostgreSQL database and can be used for further analysis.
